              Louis Higgins (b. 1999, UK) is a composer, filmmaker, and writer
              working at the intersection of music, film, and critical theory.
              Since beginning his journey in composition in 2012 and directing
              films for three years, Higgins has developed a distinctive voice
              that bridges audio and visual media. He has created scores for
              short films and documentaries, including the soundtrack for Into
              the Light, which was selected for the Rome Independent Film
              Festival. His collaborations include work with artist Nic
              Fiddian-Green and a longstanding relationship with London’s
              Roundhouse, where he initially worked in advertising sound
              editing. At the Roundhouse, he went on to produce multiple
              episodes of the Poetry Slam Live show and recently completed a
              project for their commissioned Audio Canvas award.

              Higgins has also worked extensively as a freelance composer and
              sound designer for Land Design Studio, a leading museum and
              exhibition design company. His recent projects include an updated
              experiential soundtrack for the Centre of the Cell, the world’s
              first science education centre located within a biomedical
              research laboratory.

              In addition to his creative practice, Higgins engages deeply with
              critical theory and contemporary discourse. He directed the film
              Dasein, an exploration of Martin Heidegger’s philosophy, which has
              sparked significant interest in online philosophical forums and
              received endorsement from filmmaker Hellen Rollins. Higgins also
              authored an essay on André Bazin’s concept of “total cinema,”
              which was published in DIALOGUES ON CORECORE & THE CONTEMPORARY
              ONLINE AVANT-GARDE by becoming.press. This book, a landmark
              exploration of the online phenomenon of corecore, followed the
              first-ever conference on the contemporary online avant-garde,
              further underscoring Higgins’s ability to navigate the interplay
              between traditional media theory and emerging digital cultures.

              Through his work, Higgins continues to explore the dynamic
              relationship between sound, image, and storytelling, leveraging
              his practical and post-production expertise to create immersive,
              thought-provoking experiences.
